# Tracing CI/CD with Datadog
{: .fs-9 }

You can start tracing your development workflow since a commit is pushed to your repository until the pipeline is ready to be deployed.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Tracing your pipelines

You will obtain different insights about your pipeline in the `Pipelines` and `Pipelines Executions` sections under the CI menu in Datadog once your CI provider has been instrumented.

Some of those insights are:
* Status of the last pipeline.
* Average, P95 and last pipeline duration.
* Finished pipelines per hour.
* Failure rate of a certain pipeline.
* Stage breakdown.

## Tracing your tests

You will obtain different insights about your tests in the `Test Plans` and `Test Executions` sections under the CI menu in Datadog once your tests had been instrumented.

Some of those insights for a certain commit are:
* Test statuses.
* Total number of executed tests.
* Failure rate.
* Wall time clock duration for the test phase.
* Avg delta duration change between commits.
